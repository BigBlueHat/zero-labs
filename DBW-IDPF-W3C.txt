i was disappointed that the word "book" didn't come


Fran T.

thanks BillM on engaging with him last night
I was wrong on a few things
I had also not known everything that was in the final MOU
I had only seen a draft

portability of epub files is important
the ability to offline
to sell as individual files

there are risks that w3c is of the web, and doesn't deal with offline
we're one small grain of sand

how can we be sure that this offline process will continue
